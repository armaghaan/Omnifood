# Omnifood

This project was created as a learning exercise using HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript. The website is a fictional example of a company called Omnifood, which offers AI-powered prepared food for any needs. You can view the website at https://armaghaan.github.io/Omnifood/
The goal of this project was to gain experience in front-end web development and to learn how to create a simple, functional website from scratch.
